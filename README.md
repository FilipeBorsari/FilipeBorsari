- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @FilipeBorsari, in 05/12/22 i started my journey to learn how to code.
- Right now i'm learning Python (following this Roadmap https://roadmap.sh/backend)
- I plan to save all my projects and exercises here, to track my progress. 

If you notice anything in my code that I could or should have done differently, please let me know.
